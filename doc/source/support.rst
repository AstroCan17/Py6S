Support
================================

Py6S was developed by the author as part of his PhD, and has been maintained and developed further since then.

Free support is available to a limited extent, via the mailing list detailed below.

Paid support is available via the author's freelance business - please see `www.rtwilson.com <http://www.rtwilson.com>`_ for more details.

The main place to report problems or ask for help is the `Py6S mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/py6s>`_ - please join the list and send a message if you want help with Py6S, or have bugs or feature requests to report. The mailing list is also where release announcements will be made and the future direction of Py6S discussed.
